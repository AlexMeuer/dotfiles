# dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles. I don't expect anyone else to install or use them so they may not be kept in working order. If you _are_ interesting in using them, let me know and I'll double-check the process for you.

## Installation

### Mac

Run `brew_install` then `make_links`. The brew installation script installs pretty much everything needed, including my `simple-bar` configuration of `Ubersicht` and VS Code extensions. The linking script just symlinks the config files to their relevant locations.

### Linux

My flavour of choice is Manjaro i3. As of writing this, I don't have the dotfiles to hand.
